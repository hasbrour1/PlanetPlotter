Planet Plotter
Created By Robert Hasbrouck and Kayla Hasbrouck November 2015

This website was created for a school project using html, css, and javascript.  Script.js has all the main code for the planet plotting calculations.  On the calculations page you can enter a date in 4 different formats, and it will plot the planets how they were aligned on that date on the graphic below, not to scale.  The graphs below the graphic are the actual calculated planet positions realative to the sun.
